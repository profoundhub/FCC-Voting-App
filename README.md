# Build a Voting App

* [ ] Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.
* [x] Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects.
* [x] Setup Git Repo
* [x] Setup Cloud 9
* [x] Setup Heroku
* [ ] Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
* [ ] User Story: As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
* [ ] User Story: As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
* [ ] User Story: As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
* [ ] User Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
* [ ] User Story: As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
* [ ] User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
* [ ] User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
* [ ] User Story: As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
* [ ] Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.
* [ ] You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
